  ## Credits

  Meg Meyers was a huge help in making this project, especially in writing the viewl all employees function which was the most confusing to understand. I also referenced the class repo lessons for examples in how to utilize dotenv, sequelize, and inquirer. The seeds.sql document was also provided by Meg which was a huge help in saving time. In addition I visited several stackoverflow threads in order to help with minor bug / styntax editing.
